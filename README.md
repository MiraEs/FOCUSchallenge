You need to create a list of sports players. Each Basketball player would have the

following properties:

1. Name

2. Country

3. Height

4. Weight

5. Age

You may assume the player can belong to the following countries only:

 France

 Germany

 USA

 Spain

 Australia

The initial screen would show the list of the players added. Initially the table would be

empty. The user can add a player by tapping a button in the navigation bar. The

individual cells of the table would show the following details: player’s name, country flag

and player’s age.

You can add a new player by entering the player details mentioned above.

Also, by tapping the individual rows in the table, you would be shown the player details

that were entered. Further, the user can also update the player details and delete the

player.
